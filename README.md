# mernApp
app to calculate surgical "things". This has a very simple routing sytems. While its not built as of this now, I wish to have:

The user (eventually, securly log in and...) see the landing page (seeing past caluculations that they can delete or see in more detail and edit. Without login this will be hard coded examples, so for now maybe common use examples are present)

Then, User will click into the calculator for a new (surgery). 

User will be directed to the form with varius sliders and/or text boxes, on submit the form will spit out a card of info to the landing page, possibly with a green color to indicate "most recent".


# Reasons

This is a simple website to try different things within a MERN stack. Eventually I will refactor into a React/react native, but for now it will be an express app that using Restful routing conventions. Soon after i complete it, i will add (possibly pointless) Api calls, secure login, two factor identification, or anything else I want more practice on. Learning. It's difficult fun sometimes.
